## What is this?  
My personal website.  
  
## How do I run this?  
Make sure you have [hugo](www.gohugo.io) installed. Run `npm install`. Run `gulp`. It opens at `localhost:1313`.  
  
## What is the layout?  
HTML files go into `layouts`. The `partials` directory is made up of ui elements that would be otherwise repetitive in the interface, injected into wherever they need to be with `hugo`. The styles and images are contained within `static`. [Less](http://lesscss.org/) is used for conveniency.  
  
## How do I put this into production?  
Run the `hugo` command. If all goes well, it should generate a `public` directory. Dump the contents of that file onto wherever you want to run the website from.
